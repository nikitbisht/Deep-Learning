# ðŸ§  Deep Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and code related to deep learning.  
Itâ€™s part of my journey to deeply understand neural networks and their advanced variants.

## âœ… Topics Covered

- Basic Neural Network Concepts
- Activation Functions
- Backpropagation & Optimization
- Sequential Models using PyTorch
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)


## ðŸš€ Purpose

This repo helps me:

- Consolidate what I learn with clean notes and code
- Practice implementing models from scratch and using PyTorch
- Serve as a quick revision guide later
